##Getting Started

>Meganote uses NPM to manage dependencies, so install Node if necessary.
After cloning the repository, run `npm start` in the directory containing the cloned files.
```shell
git clone <this repo>
cd <this project folder>
npm start
```
This will start a local webserver on port 8000.

##Deployment

To deploy Meganote, copy the app folder to the remote server after ensuring bower_components (not included in this repo) is included.
